/**
 * The API to the transport layer.
 *
 * Concrete implementations support specific transports such as Proxygen
 * and RSocket.
 *
 * The primary method in this API is "getChannel()" which returns a
 * "ThriftChannelIf" object which is used to interface between the
 * Thrift layer and this layer.  A separate call to "getChannel()"
 * must be made for each RPC.
 *
 * "ClientConnectionIf" objects operate on an event base that must be
 * supplied when an object is constructed - see comments on each
 * subclass for more details.  The event base loop must be running.
 * This is the event base on which callbacks from the networking layer
 * take place.  This is also the event base on which calls to
 * "ThriftChannelIf" objects must be made from ThriftClient objects.
 *
 * Multiple "ClientConnectionIf" objects may be present at the same
 * time, each will manage a separate network connection and are
 * generally on different event bases (threads).
 *
 * All method, excepting getChannel() must be called on the same event
 * base that manages the connection.
