/**
 * Interface used by the Thrift layer to communicate with the
 * Transport layer.  The same interface is used both on the client
 * side and the server side.
 *
 * On the client side, this interface is used to send a request to the
 * server, while on the server side it is used to send a response to
 * the client.
 *
 * Implementations are specialized for different kinds of transports
 * (e.g., HTTP/2, RSocket) and using different strategies (e.g., one
 * RPC per HTTP/2 stream, or multiple RPCs per HTTP/2 stream).  The
 * same implementation is used on both the client and the server side.
 *
 * The lifetime of a channel object depends on the implementation - on
 * the one extreme, a new object may be created for each RPC, while on
 * the other extreme a single object may be use for the lifetime of a
 * connection.
 *
 * The channel object supports streaming as follows:
 * - Server and client keeps an instance of the channel as a twin of
 *   each other. The input in one side is perceived as output in the other
 *   side, and vice versa.
 *
 * - For RPCs with streaming requests, the channel provides the
 *   "getOutput()" method to obtain the stream into which the client
 *   streams messages.
 *   The channel also provides "setInput(stream)" method for the server
 *   to register a sink that is to receive these messages.
 *
 * - For RPCs with streaming responses, the operations are reversed.
 *   The client registers a sink for incoming messages via the channel's
 *   "setInput(stream)" method. While the server uses the channel's
 *   "getOutput()" method to obtain a stream and to use it for streaming
 *   messages.
